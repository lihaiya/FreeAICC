The sample code is the backend code of the web customer service. The original frontend is outdated and is still being updated. 

As the FreeAICC is too powerful, the team is very worried that the product will be used for illegal purposes. Therefore, if you need the source code, please contact us separately by email, describing your usage scenario, the nature of your enterprise, etc.

## 😄We firmly believe that only when software is used can it bring value to users and allow itself to iterate!
## 😄Sustainability: Continuous iteration since 2014, members come from ecological enterprises such as Cisco, Avaya, Huawei, FreeSWITCH, etc., long-termism!
# Target
We are committed to becoming the global leader in: open source call center systems, large model call center systems, large model inbound robots, large model outbound robots, telephone robots, intelligent call center systems, and large model intelligent customer service systems!

# FreeAICC Vision and basic functions

Vision:
The FreeAICC project was born out of FreeIPCC. In the era of big models, it is the first to apply big models and artificial intelligence to the field of real-time communication!
1. AI agents improve service efficiency;
2. AI calls improve the efficiency of business notifications and business reminders;
3. AI agent assistance makes agents easier!

Basic functions:
1. Intelligent routing: Based on preset rules or AI algorithms, customer requests are automatically assigned to the most appropriate customer service representative or self-service module to ensure that customer issues are handled promptly and professionally.
2. IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system: Provides flexible voice menu design to guide customers to complete common operations such as inquiries and repairs by themselves, reduce the pressure on manual agents, and improve service efficiency.
3. Data analysis and reporting: Built-in powerful data analysis engine, automatically generates various service reports, such as call volume statistics, customer satisfaction surveys, service efficiency analysis, etc., to provide data basis for decision-making.
4. Open API and plug-in extension: Provide rich API interfaces to support third-party developers to expand functions or customize development based on our platform. At the same time, we will also actively maintain a plug-in market and collect high-quality plug-ins for users to choose from.
5. Highly configurable: Provide an intuitive configuration interface so that users can adjust system parameters and optimize workflows according to their own needs without programming, and achieve rapid customization and deployment.
6. Community support and ecological co-construction: Establish an active open source community to encourage users to share experiences, put forward requirements, contribute code, and jointly promote the continuous development and improvement of the project. We believe that through the power of the community, our open source call center will continue to evolve and become a leader in the field of customer service!
